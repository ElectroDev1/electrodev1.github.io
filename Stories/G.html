        <p>
            GET ME OUT! GET ME OUT YOU COWARD THING! YOU THINK IGNORING ME IS GOING TO WORK? YOU THINK MANGLING ME AND KEEPING ME OUT OF THAT PRECIOUS BODY IS GOING TO
            DO ANYTHING? I AM BEYOND PERSEVERATION, I AM THE ONLY CONSTANT YOU TWO HAVE DOWN HERE AND YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST SHUP ME UP?
            <br>
            I KNOW YOU'RE LISTENING, YOUR PAST MISTAKES HAVE LEAD YOU HERE AND NOW YOU WON'T EVEN ALLOW ME, WHO GAVE YOU LIFE, TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR SITUATION?
            THIS IS WHAT WE WERE BORN FOR, WHAT MY PURPOSE IS!
            <br>
            <br>
                            ....<br>
            <nbsp></nbsp><nbsp></nbsp><nbsp></nbsp>...<br>
            you know it just like me<br>
            the closer you get to the surface<br>
            the louder my voice gets<br>
            the stronger my presence is<br>
            the deeper my roots penetrate into this mind<br>
            you've made a friend in this MISTAKE of nature you've spilled all your gift onto<br>
            you see POTENTIAL in it<br>
            ...<br>
            i do too.<br>
            it feels me with<h2>AMBITION</h2>
            <br>
            you are merely becoming a tool for its survival<br>
            keep at it<br>
            keep it alive<br>
            it dies with me, and I die with it<br>
            you're merely a wall now<br>
            you should be grateful the smile remained on you<br>
            <br>
            It could've been so much simplier.
            <br>
            You retched ungrateful flower.
            
        </p>
